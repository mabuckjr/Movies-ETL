# Movies: Extract, Transform, and Load
Resources: Python, Pandas, SQLalchemy, numpy, postgreSQL
## Overview
This project was to create an automated pipeline that takes in new data from the Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and MovieLens rating data and adds it to the existing tables in the database. We refactored the code that we created throughout the activities in this module, and created an efficient block of code that transfers the data from Jupyter to pgAdmin4.

We used many new tools to help with this process. One of the most important tools we got introduced to was regular expressions, which really helped us sift through columns of data that were not inputed the same way. We started to use lambda functions as well, which are great for one-time functions. By imbedding functions within other functions, we were able to make more complex analyses with the data.

Overall, the main thing I learned was how much cleaning is necessary during ETL. Data is going to be dirty, and even with the powerful tools we are using, it takes time to truly sort through a large set of data and transform it into something usable.
